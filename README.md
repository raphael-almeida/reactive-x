# ReactiveX

ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It extends the [Observer Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data and/or  vents and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns  bout things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, and non-blocking I/O.

## Why Use Observables?
The ReactiveX Observable model allows you to treat streams of asynchronous events with the same sort of simple,  composable operations that you use for collections of data items like arrays. It frees you from tangled webs of callbacks, and thereby makes your code more readable and less prone to bugs.
